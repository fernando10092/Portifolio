                        <P>I am currently pursuing a Postgraduate degree in Machine Learning Engineering at FIAP and have completed a Full Stack Python Development course at EBAC - British School of Creative Arts and Technology. I hold degrees in Systems Analysis and Development, Accounting Sciences, an MBA in Advanced Financial Management, and Business Administration.

                            As a versatile and proactive professional, I have solid knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Python, and MySQL. Additionally, I stay up to date with the latest trends in web development by taking complementary courses.

                            I demonstrate analytical skills and proactivity, as evidenced by my experience as an Administrative and Financial Analyst, where I was responsible for implementing financial systems, automating tasks with Python, and negotiating with suppliers to reduce costs, leading to significant improvements in operational efficiency. I actively participated in the development of a custom website for my own wedding, as well as other small projects, applying advanced web development concepts.

                            I have experience in back-end development, including database structuring and optimization, API creation, authentication and security implementation, as well as server management and system integration. My soft skills include problem-solving, teamwork, and adaptability-essential qualities for thriving in dynamic and multifunctional environments.

                            I am ready to take on challenges and contribute innovative solutions to development projects, combining my financial analysis expertise with my passion for software development.
